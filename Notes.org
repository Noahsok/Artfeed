* Notes:
** when post link name and email should be pre- poluated bc to post the user must be a member of the community
** Maybe limit image size in tiny mce
** make link and text either or not both
** make  name and email not visable on comment form page (finished)

** how to make voting more inticing. 
** idea: clicking on link will redirect user 
** "Artnews" saves link and next time user goes on AN they get asked what they think about link
** Reading history
** Comment history
** Link history
** Favorite

** allow down votes or don't allow down votes
